=========================================================

This is a brief summary of *Codewit.us: A Platform for Diverse
Perspectives in Coding*, presented at the [53rd ACM Technical Symposium
on Computer Science Education
(SIGCSE’22)](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/) and published in the
proceedings.

Preface
=======

-   There are ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computing
-   Recommendations highlight a need for teaching computing in ways that
    are [relevant and meaningful to broader
    audiences](https://doi.org/10.1145/3502870.3506568)
-   Observed students’ inclination to seek lessons via YouTube, with
    mixed results
    -   There are some good amateur tutorials on many programming
        essentials
    -   Videos tended to use the same contexts as often seen in
        traditional CS classes (e.g. tip calculators, puzzles/games,
        bowling scores, etc.)
    -   Some propogated bad practices (e.g. every loop being
        `while(true)`)
    -   Students often passively watched videos, did not immediately
        apply the practices
-   Our [previous research on students’ interests](../interests/)
    indicated significant discrepancies in some areas of students’
    interests, especially by gender:
    -   **Games** - Majority 68% vs Minority 36% (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=5.50,
        df=1, p&lt;.05)
    -   **Robots/microcontrollers/electronics** Majority 36% vs Minority
        14% (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=4.87,df=1, p&lt;.05)

**We wanted to provide students with new perspectives for applications
of coding fundamentals, while also facilitating hands-on learning of
those skills.**

Developing Learning Materials
=============================

We want to facilitate learning through both [affective and cognitive
learning outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) by
engaging students in active learning.

We also want materials to be **student-driven** to share their unique
perspectives. \* [Chico State](https://csuchico.edu) and [UC Santa
Barbara](https://ucsb.edu) are **Hispanic-Serving Institutions** with
unique opportunity to share perspectives of historically marginalized
students

Inclusive Video Demonstrations
------------------------------

We hired students to share brief demonstrations of how they would relate
CS1 topics to *their lives and interests*.

However, the *Covid-19 pandemic* forced us to record from home. We
purchased HD webcams, USB microphones, and ring lights for each student
(under $200 per student). They recorded using
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to capture their [Replit
IDE](https://repl.it) with a picture-in-picture video of their faces.

As restrictions lifted, we began recording using campus studios
featuring transparent lightboards which allow the student to face the
camera in higher quality video.

Interactive Drill-and-Practice
------------------------------

We developed small C++ coding problems that emphasized concepts that
corresponded with each video. We used
[CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/) to host the problems in an
interactive environment.

Preliminary Investigation
=========================

-   Two semesters of CS1 course (n=216) at Chico State (*CSCI 111
    Programming and Algorithms I*)
-   Both semesters were online, synchronous courses (Zoom) due to the
    pandemic
-   **Control** (n=161) - assigned readings from eBooks
-   **Intervention** (n=55) - assigned readings *plus* videos and
    workouts
    -   A video was embedded in the learning management system (LMS)
        after the assigned reading on the corresponding concept.
    -   Sets of problems on the same concept were organized as
        ‘workouts’ and direct links to the workouts were provided in the
        LMS after the video.
