Preface
=======

What motivated the study?

Previous research on students’ [interests](../interests/)

Developing Learning Materials
=============================

We want to facilitate learning through both affective and cognitive
learning outcomes by engaging students in active learning.

Inclusive Video Demonstrations
------------------------------

We hired students to share brief demonstrations of how they would relate
CS1 topics to *their lives and interests*.

However, the Covid-19 pandemic forced us to record from home. We
purchased HD webcams, USB microphones, and ring lights for each student
(under $200 per student). They recorded using
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to capture their [Replit
IDE](https://repl.it) with a picture-in-picture video of their faces.

As restrictions lifted, we began recording using campus studios
featuring transparent lightboards which allow the student to face the
camera in higher quality video.

Interactive Drill-and-Practice
------------------------------

We developed small C++ coding problems that emphasized concepts that
corresponded with each video. We used
[CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/) to host the problems in an
interactive environment.

Preliminary Investigation
=========================

-   Two semesters of CS1 course (n=216) at Chico State (*CSCI 111
    Programming and Algorithms I*)
-   Both semesters were online, synchronous courses (Zoom) due to the
    pandemic
-   **Control** (n=161) - assigned readings from eBooks
-   **Intervention** (n=55) - assigned readings *plus* videos and
    workouts
    -   A video was embedded in the learning management system (LMS)
        after the assigned reading on the corresponding concept.
    -   Sets of problems on the same concept were organized as
        ‘workouts’ and direct links to the workouts were provided in the
        LMS after the video.
