# Codewit.us: A Platform for Diverse Perspectives in Coding

This is a brief summary of *Codewit.us: A Platform for Diverse Perspectives in Coding*, presented at the [53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE'22)](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/) and published in the proceedings.

This presentation page is available at [learnbyfailure.com/sigcse2022-platform](https://learnbyfailure.com/sigcse2022-platform/) and its source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbuffardi/sigcse2022-platform/).

# Preface

* There are ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computing
* Recommendations highlight a need for teaching computing in ways that are [relevant and meaningful to broader audiences](https://doi.org/10.1145/3502870.3506568)
* Observed students' inclination to seek lessons via YouTube, with mixed results
  * There are some good amateur tutorials on many programming essentials
  * Videos tended to use the same contexts as often seen in traditional CS classes (e.g. tip calculators, puzzles/games, bowling scores, etc.)
  * Some propogated bad practices (e.g. every loop being `while(true)`)
  * Students often passively watched videos, did not immediately apply the practices
* Our [previous research on students' interests](../interests/) indicated significant discrepancies in some areas of students' interests, especially by gender:
  * **Games** - Majority 68% vs Minority 36% ($\chi$^2^=5.50, df=1, p<.05)
  * **Robots/microcontrollers/electronics** Majority 36% vs Minority 14% ($\chi$^2^=4.87,df=1, p<.05)

**We want to provide students with new perspectives and applications of coding fundamentals, while also facilitating hands-on learning of those skills.**

# Developing Learning Materials

We want to facilitate learning through both [affective and cognitive learning outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) by engaging students in active learning.

We also want materials to be **student-driven** to share their unique perspectives.

* [Chico State](https://csuchico.edu) and [UC Santa Barbara](https://ucsb.edu) are **Hispanic-Serving Institutions**
* Unique opportunity to share perspectives of historically marginalized students

## Inclusive Video Demonstrations

We hired students to share brief demonstrations of how they would relate CS1 topics to *their lives and interests*.

However, the *Covid-19 pandemic* forced us to record from home. We provided students with:

* 1080p HD webcams, 
* USB microphones, 
* Ring lights
* Cost approaching $200 per student
* Students recorded using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to capture their [Replit IDE](https://repl.it) with a picture-in-picture video of their faces.

As restrictions lifted, we began recording using campus studios featuring transparent lightboards which allow the student to face the camera in higher quality video.

### Example

## Interactive Drill-and-Practice

We developed small C++ coding problems that emphasized concepts that corresponded with each video. We used [CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/) to host the problems in an interactive environment.

All our [C++ exercises are public on CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/gym/exercises/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=c%2B%2B)

# Preliminary Investigation

* Two semesters of CS1 course (n=216) at Chico State (*CSCI 111 Programming and Algorithms I*)
* Both semesters were online, synchronous courses (Zoom) due to the pandemic
* **Control** (n=161) - assigned readings from eBooks
* **Intervention** (n=55) - assigned readings *plus* videos and workouts
  * A video was embedded in the learning management system (LMS) after the assigned reading on the corresponding concept.
  * Sets of problems on the same concept were organized as 'workouts' and direct links to the workouts were provided in the LMS after the video.
* Students answered Pre/Post semester surveys to guage **affective outcomes**
  * Adopted instruments to measure general affect (i.e. sense of belonging) and self-efficacy specific to C++ skills
  * Post survey also gathered students' self-reported usage of videos and practice
  
# Insights

Compared to the control, we found students with the materials available **showed significantly greater gains in affective outcomes**

 * Control ($\Delta$ M=0.18, sd=0.47) 
 * Intervention ($\Delta$ M=0.38, sd=0.47)
 * Wilcoxon test rejects null hypothesis (p<.05)

![Box plots comparing pre and post scores for affective outcomes. The intervention shows a larger gain than the control.](affective.png)

However, we found no significant difference in students' self-efficacy with specific C++ skills

* Control ($\Delta$ M=2.08, sd=1.29) 
* Intervention ($\Delta$ M=2.26, sd=1.18) 
* Wilcoxon test found no significant differences (p=.247)
 
We also investigated students' voluntary usage of the videos and practice problems:

![Bar charts show the majority of students watched videos either weekly or more than once per week, while the majority of students practiced either on a monthly basis or less often](frequency.png)


# Platform Development

We decided to develop a software platform to give our students a figurative platform to share their perspectives.

[Codewit.us](https://codewit.us) integrates the [brief video tutorials with corresponding programming problems](https://codewit.us/tutorial/variables_soccer/).

* CodeWorkout maintained as the engine for practice
* Codewit.us is *Free and Open Source Software* [on GitHub](https://github.com/kbuffardi/codewitus/) but also [hosted for your use, free of charge](https://codewit.us/)
  
We have piloted Codewit.us as a supplementary source for students. *Stay tuned for new findings...*
