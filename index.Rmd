# Codewit.us: A Platform for Diverse Perspectives in Coding

This is a brief summary of *Codewit.us: A Platform for Diverse Perspectives in Coding*, presented at the [53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE'22)](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/) and published in the proceedings.

This presentation page is available at [learnbyfailure.com/sigcse2022-platform](https://learnbyfailure.com/sigcse2022-platform/) and its source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbuffardi/sigcse2022-platform/).

# Preface

* There are ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computing
* Recommendations highlight a need for teaching computing in ways that are [relevant and meaningful to broader audiences](https://doi.org/10.1145/3502870.3506568)
* Observed students' inclination to seek lessons via YouTube, with mixed results
  * There are some good amateur tutorials on many programming essentials
  * Videos tended to use the same contexts as often seen in traditional CS classes (e.g. tip calculators, puzzles/games, bowling scores, etc.)
  * Some propogated bad practices (e.g. every loop being `while(true)`)
  * Students often passively watched videos, did not immediately apply the practices
* Our [previous research on students' interests](../interests/) indicated significant discrepancies in some areas of students' interests, especially by gender:
  * **Games** - Majority 68% vs Minority 36% ($\chi$^2^=5.50, df=1, p<.05)
  * **Robots/microcontrollers/electronics** Majority 36% vs Minority 14% ($\chi$^2^=4.87,df=1, p<.05)

**We want to provide students with new perspectives and applications of coding fundamentals, while also facilitating hands-on learning of those skills.**

# Developing Learning Materials

We want to facilitate learning through both [affective and cognitive learning outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) by engaging students in active learning.

We also want materials to be **student-driven** to share their unique perspectives.

* [Chico State](https://csuchico.edu) and [UC Santa Barbara](https://ucsb.edu) are **Hispanic-Serving Institutions**
* Unique opportunity to share perspectives of historically marginalized students

## Inclusive Video Demonstrations

We hired students to share brief demonstrations of how they would relate CS1 topics to *their lives and interests*.

However, the *Covid-19 pandemic* forced us to record from home. We provided students with:

* 1080p HD webcams, 
* USB microphones, 
* Ring lights
* Cost approaching $200 per student
* Students recorded using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to capture their [Replit IDE](https://repl.it) with a picture-in-picture video of their faces.

As restrictions lifted, we began recording using campus studios featuring transparent lightboards which allow the student to face the camera in higher quality video.

### Example

## Interactive Drill-and-Practice

We developed small C++ coding problems that emphasized concepts that corresponded with each video. We used [CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/) to host the problems in an interactive environment.

All our [C++ exercises are public on CodeWorkout](https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/gym/exercises/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=c%2B%2B)

# Preliminary Investigation

* Two semesters of CS1 course (n=216) at Chico State (*CSCI 111 Programming and Algorithms I*)
* Both semesters were online, synchronous courses (Zoom) due to the pandemic
* **Control** (n=161) - assigned readings from eBooks
* **Intervention** (n=55) - assigned readings *plus* videos and workouts
  * A video was embedded in the learning management system (LMS) after the assigned reading on the corresponding concept.
  * Sets of problems on the same concept were organized as 'workouts' and direct links to the workouts were provided in the LMS after the video.
* Students answered Pre/Post semester surveys to guage **affective outcomes**
  * Adopted instruments to measure general affect (i.e. sense of belonging) and self-efficacy specific to C++ skills
  * Post survey also gathered students' self-reported usage of videos and practice
  
# Insights

Compared to the control, we found students with the materials available **showed significantly greater gains in affective outcomes**

 * Control ($\Delta$ M=0.18, sd=0.47) 
 * Intervention ($\Delta$ M=0.38, sd=0.47)
 * Wilcoxon test rejects null hypothesis (p<.05)

![Box plots comparing pre and post scores for affective outcomes. The intervention shows a larger gain than the control.](affective.png)

However, we found no significant difference in students' self-efficacy with specific C++ skills

* Control ($\Delta$ M=2.08, sd=1.29) 
* Intervention ($\Delta$ M=2.26, sd=1.18) 
* Wilcoxon test found no significant differences (p=.247)
 
We also investigated students' voluntary usage of the videos and practice problems:

![Bar charts show the majority of students watched videos either weekly or more than once per week, while the majority of students practiced either on a monthly basis or less often](frequency.png)


# Platform Development

We decided to develop a software platform to give our students a figurative platform to share their perspectives.

[Codewit.us](https://codewit.us) integrates the [brief video tutorials with corresponding programming problems](https://codewit.us/tutorial/variables_soccer/).

* CodeWorkout maintained as the engine for practice
* Codewit.us is *Free and Open Source Software* [on GitHub](https://github.com/kbuffardi/codewitus/) but also [hosted for your use, free of charge](https://codewit.us/)
  
We have piloted Codewit.us as a supplementary source for students. *Stay tuned for new findings...*

abstract = {To broaden participation in computing, learning materials should relate to a diverse spectrum of student perspectives. This paper introduces Codewit.us, an online platform for under-represented minority (URM) students in computing to share examples of how coding fundamentals can be demonstrated in contexts relevant to their own lives. Codewit.us features brief video demonstrations by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and female students, paired with interactive drill-and-practice coding problems on matching programming concepts.This experience report describes the software and pedagogical design for Codewit.us. The report includes preliminary findings from our investigation into the diversity of students' interests, usage of Codewit.us videos and practice problems, as well as students' affect and self-efficacy. A needs assessment found significant differences in certain interests associated with students' gender. Preliminary findings indicated greater improvements in students' affective outcomes in a course offering with the Codewit.us learning materials than in courses without them. The paper also discusses opportunities discovered for broadening participation in CS by relating coding to new perspectives seldom represented in introductory programming courses.},
